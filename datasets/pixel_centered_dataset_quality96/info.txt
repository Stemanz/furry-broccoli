This contains:
ISO 200 pictures processed with DPP3 with default settings
ISO 1600 pictures, +2EV, processed with DPP3 with +2 NR settings (both chrominance and luminance)

They are paired, and dataset_n_ISO200.JPG / dataset_n_ISO1600.JPG have been shot with shutter speeds parameters to have the
same amount of illumination.

Plus, they have been manually pixel-centered, because ISO200 and ISO1600 images are, due to unknown reasons, NOT exactly overlapping.
